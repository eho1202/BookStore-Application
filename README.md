# BookStore-Application  

### Final project for COE528    

A single-window GUI based bookstore app that allows customers to purchase books and earn/redeem points. It also allows administrators to access two databases: the book inventory and the customer database. The admins have the ability to add or remove books and customers from the store with ease.
